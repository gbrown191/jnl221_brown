			<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic raged, schools, workplaces and other gatherings around the country were shut down or moved to online settings. As lawmakers and health experts looked to limit large gatherings and enforce social distancing, a population for which that would be exceedingly difficult emerged: the incarcerated.</p>
		</section>
	<section>
			<p>Aside from drops in 2019 and 2020, the U.S. natural rate of interaction at 500 prisoners per 100,000 residents remains above the world’s average rate of 100 per 100,000, the <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/u-s-has-worlds-highest-incarceration-rate/">Population Reference Bureau</a> reported. The U.S. consistently remains one of the highest incarcerators in the world, barring one-off outliers like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-country-with-the-highest-murder-rate-now-has-the-highest-incarceration-rate-b5401da7">El Salvador</a>.</p>
		</section>
	<section>
			<p>Mirroring a national decrease, the number of in-house prisoners in jails throughout New York¹ counties, excluding New York City, dropped around 35% from 2019 to 2020 when the pandemic began, according to data published by the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Jail-Population-By-County-Beginning-1997/nymx-kgkn/about_data">New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services</a>. Experts attribute that decrease to circumstances beyond the impacts of the pandemic.</p>

			<p>Pandemic-caused case processing delays and “contemporaneous changes to bail and drug policies likely played at least some role,” Cynthia Najdowski, an associate professor and the head of the Department of Psychology at the University at Albany, wrote in a statement to the reporter.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>In January, Stateline <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/25/shortage-of-prosecutors-judges-leads-to-widespread-court-backlogs/">reported</a> that New York had nearly 120,000 pending cases according to court statistics available. Last September, the New York City Bar Association <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/documents.nycbar.org/files/NYCBarReportRepealTheConstCapOnJudges.pdf">called</a> on state legislatures to repeal the cap on the number of judges in the state courts laid out in the constitution. </p>
		</section>


	<section>
			<p>Bureaucratic delays, however, are not the only reason for the drop in jail populations. Some of it was by design.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>“Jail populations were affected shortly prior to the pandemic by bail reform legislation, which became effective in January 2020, and by steps taken in many jurisdictions in 2019 in anticipation of the bail reform provisions,” Robert Worden wrote in a statement to the reporter.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>Worden, an associate professor of criminal justice and public policy at the University at Albany, called isolating the impacts of the pandemic and legislative changes a “tall analytical order.”</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>New York eliminated money bail and jail for the bulk of cases involving misdemeanors and lower-level felonies in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/facts-bail-reform-new-york-how-pretrial-detention-and-release-works-now#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20New%20York%20ended,the%20default%20in%20these%20cases.">Brennan Center for Justice</a>. The law was passed by Democrat supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>Other states have implemented bail reform. In September 2023, <a href="https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/cash-bail-changes-2023-safe-t-act#:~:text=Beginning%20on%20September%2018%2C%202023,system%20and%20what%20it%20means.">Illinois</a> courts eliminated the cash bail system, opting for a “pretrial release.” The New York law allowed those accused of misdemeanors and non-violent felony charges to go free until a court hearing or gave them conditions such as electronic monitoring.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>The law was enacted on January 1, 2020, and “sought to make release rather than detention the default in these cases.” After the bail reform was passed, New York Republican lawmakers <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2024/03/08/new-york-republicans-push-for-changes-to-bail-laws">called</a> for changes and a rollback of the law, citing statistics and incidents that back up their claims that bail reform increases crime.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>In March, State Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay referred to a <a href="https://datacollaborativeforjustice.org/work/bail-reform/does-new-yorks-bail-reform-law-impact-recidivism-a-quasi-experimental-test-in-the-states-suburban-and-upstate-regions/">study</a> in a release from John Jay College of Criminal Justice which said that 66% of people with a prior arrest detained and released in suburban and upstate New York counties by the bail law were re-arrested within two years.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>The number of people in New York jails did decrease after the introduction of the bail reform law — the numbers between 2020 and 2023 were the lowest since the state began collecting the data in 1997. The Brennan Center wrote in 2024 that the goal to lessen the number of people in jails “has been undermined in the subsequent legislative sessions,” citing revisions made to the bill.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>Although <a href="https://www.albany.edu/news-center/news/2023-scj-study-finds-states-bail-reform-law-did-not-increase-crime">studies have found</a> there is no substantial evidence that bail reform policy is linked with a rise in crime, the revisions provided exceptions in which judges could set bail for lower-level offenses and expanded the list of offenses bail could be set for.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>It is unclear whether the adjustments made to bail reform will change or undo the decrease in jail populations in the years following implementation. Although in-house numbers in the 2020s are lower than in previous years, they continue to creep up around two percent year-to-year.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>“Since 2020, the legislation has been tweaked some, though how much that has affected patterns of judicial decision-making is an open question,” Worden wrote.</p>

	<section>
			<p>Onondaga County officials have <a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/uptick-in-property-crime-cases-sparks-debate-on-bail-reform-and-repeat-offenders">voiced concerns</a> with New York bail reform, citing similar criticism as Republican officials that the policy may add to crime and limit punishment on repeat offenders.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>Onondaga County Jail, which accounts for around four percent of New York’s total in-house jail population, saw an over 38% decrease in population between 2019 and 2020. Since 2020, the number has increased, and 2023’s figure is a 35% increase from the first year of bail reform.</p>
		</section>

	<section>
			<p>The data observed in Onondaga County is not unique to the area. Across New York, in-house incarceration numbers dipped in the early 2020s and have continued to increase since. A mixture of pandemic precaution, bail reform and bureaucratic delays has changed jails in the state — and the extent to which that change will last remains unknown.</p>
